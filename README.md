# Skull of Fate

Alone late at night in your castle, you reach out and grab the cobweb-covered head sitting on your mantle. Was this the head of a fierce enemy defeated in battle, a villager slain in one of your many conquests, a fallen comrade, a spiteful lover? You gaze into the black hollow pits where its eyes once were and start to fade in and out of consciousness, as if in a trance. Visions of the future dizzyingly pass by. Fires rage, bodies are strewn, dragons take flight.

**What future will you choose?**

## Design and Features

The **Skull of Fate** SAO (Standard Add-On) is a modern take on a tarot card, inspired by ancient Greek mythology. The Moirai‚Äîalso known as the Fates‚Äîwere the personifications of destiny. They were three sisters:

- **Clotho** (the spinner)
- **Lachesis** (the allotter)
- **Atropos** (the inevitable, a metaphor for death)

The **Skull of Fate** represents **Atropos**, providing you with a unique tarot reading about the future. Each reading is an interpretation of the cards and their meanings from the original 78-card Rider Waite Tarot deck.

**Features:**

- **Original Artwork**: The card features original artwork inspired by ancient mythology.
- **Tarot Readings**: 78 unique tarot readings accessible via NFC.
- **LED Animations**: 25 different eye animations in a variety of colors.
- **Interactive Sensors**: Includes an accelerometer, microphone, and magnetic hall effect sensor for reactive animations.
- **Dynamic RFID Writing**: Generates and writes a unique tarot reading to the RFID chip based on a randomly drawn card.
- **I2C Communication**: Acts as an I2C client, allowing advanced interactions with host devices like the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

**Modes of Operation:**

- **Default Mode**: After turning on, you can cycle through eye animations with the **left button** and optionally change the color of the LEDs with the **right button**.
  - Some LED eye modes are special and change based on the accelerometer or microphone input, making them reactive to position and sound.
- **Tarot Card Mode**: Holding down **both buttons** at the same time puts the device in tarot card mode, where a card is "drawn" at random from the deck and can be read by a phone or other NFC devices.
  - The NFC antenna is located at the upper part of the card.
  - Simply hold the reading device above the card any time after pressing both buttons to receive your reading.

### Tarot Card Mode

- **Activation**: Press **both buttons** simultaneously.
- **Function**:
  - All LEDs illuminate to indicate the mode is active.
  - A random tarot card link is written to the NFC chip based on a randomly drawn number.
- **Dynamic RFID Writing**:
  - Upon activation, the SAO generates a random number corresponding to one of the 78 tarot cards.
  - This number dynamically writes a unique NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) text record to the ST25DV RFID chip.
  - Each tarot card's meaning and interpretation are hosted on the project's GitHub repository.
- **Reading Your Tarot**:
  - Hold a smartphone or NFC reader over the top of the card.
  - No app required; a link will appear on your device.
  - Open the link to view your unique tarot reading.
  - **Example**: Drawing the "Three of Cups" provides a vision of triumph and unity amid chaos and challenge.
- **Tarot Deck**:
  - Contains all 78 cards from the Rider Waite Tarot deck.
  - Each card has a unique interpretation available via the NFC link.
  - All readings are available on the project's GitHub.

### Interactive Demos

- **Accelerometer-Based Interactions**: Animations respond to the orientation of the card.
- **Microphone-Based Reactions**: Animations change in response to sound input.
- **Magnetic Sensor**: Allows for interactions based on magnetic fields (e.g., bringing a magnet close to the sensor could trigger an effect).
- **User Customization**:
  - **Left Button**: Cycle through different animations.
  - **Right Button**: Change colors or settings within the current animation.

### SAO and Badge Interaction

The Skull of Fate SAO can interface with a host badge (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico W) via the SAO ports.

- **Connections**:
  - **Power**: Supplies power to the SAO.
  - **I2C Communication**: Allows for data exchange between the SAO and the badge.
  - **Input/Output Pins**: Enable additional interactions and controls.
- **USER1 and USER2 Ports**:
  - **USER1**:
    - Connected to a NeoPixel on the SAO.
    - Can receive signals from the badge to control the NeoPixel.
  - **USER2**:
    - Connected to the **GPO1** pin of the ST25DV RFID chip and a button on the SAO.
    - Pulled high with a 10kŒ© resistor.
    - When the RFID detects a field (read or write) or when the user presses the button, the signal goes low, allowing the badge to trigger an event.

**Interaction Demos:**

1. **GPIO Interaction**:
   - Pressing the button on the SAO sends a signal to the badge.
   - The badge can respond by lighting up its own LEDs or sending signals back to the SAO.
   - Demonstrates two-way communication between the SAO and badge.

2. **Interrupt Triggered by RFID**:
   - Reading the RFID tag on the SAO sends a signal to the badge.
   - The badge can detect this interrupt and execute actions (e.g., display a message or trigger an animation).

3. **I2C Host and Client Communication**:
   - The SAO acts as an I2C client, while the badge acts as the I2C host.
   - Commands can be sent from the badge to the SAO to control features like LEDs and animations.
   - **Examples**:
     - Turning LEDs on or off.
     - Initiating specific animations like the flame effect.
     - Reading sensor data from the SAO.

## SAO as an I2C Client

The SAO is designed to act as an I2C client, allowing for advanced interactions with a host device.

- **Arduino Code**: The SAO runs Arduino code to handle I2C communication and respond to commands.
- **Host Device**: Typically a Raspberry Pi Pico W running MicroPython.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Receive Commands**: The SAO can execute various commands sent from the host, such as changing animations or reading sensors.
  - **Send Data**: The SAO can send status updates or sensor readings back to the host.
- **Dynamic RFID Writing**:
  - The SAO dynamically writes a tarot reading to the RFID chip based on a randomly drawn number.
  - This number corresponds to a unique card in the deck hosted on GitHub.
  - Ensures each tarot reading is unique and directly linked to the user's experience.
- **Example Interactions**:
  - Host sends a command to start the flame effect on the SAO.
  - Host requests accelerometer data from the SAO.
  - Host turns on or off specific LEDs on the SAO.

- **I2C Pin Compatibility**: Discovered and corrected incompatible pin connections for the I2C client functionality.
- **Component Testing**: Included a piezo buzzer initially but later removed it to maintain silent operation.
- **LED Selection**: Experimented with two sizes of NeoPixels, ultimately standardizing on 1mm x 1mm LEDs for consistency.

### v0 Prototype on Breadboard

The v0 prototype marked our first foray into building the SAO using multiple Adafruit boards and breadboard prototyping.

**Components Used:**

- **Feather M0 Express**: Served as the primary microcontroller.
- **LIS3DH Accelerometer**: Enabled motion detection.
- **ST25DV Breakout Board**: Facilitated NFC/RFID functionality.
- **Lixie Labs LEDs**: Used for initial eye animations.

**Challenges and Learnings:**
