## Two of Cups
### Vision of a sacred oath beneath the gaze of unseen forces.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene unfolds atop a windswept hill where two figures meet within an ancient stone circle. Between them, a bronze basin filled with water reflects the sky, and they dip their cups into it, lifting them high in a ceremonial toast. The air hums with unseen energies, as if powers beyond human understanding bear witness to the vows exchanged. A distant eagleâ€™s cry echoes overhead, a symbol of promises sealed in the presence of the eternal.

In this future, the card speaks of profound bonds, shared destinies, and the merging of two paths. It represents a partnership that transcends the ordinary, guided by forces beyond mortal control. Whether this is a union of hearts, minds, or purposes, it carries the promise of mutual growth and a deeper connection. 

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to value their meaningful relationships. The vision suggests that some bonds are touched by destiny, carrying within them the potential for transformation and shared strength.
