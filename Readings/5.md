## Five of Cups
### Vision of loss and resilience amidst the ruins of the past.

As you gaze into the hollow eye sockets, you see a figure cloaked in black, standing by the edge of a fast-moving river. At their feet lie three overturned cups, the spilled liquid soaking into the ground like tears. The figure's head is bowed in sorrow, focused on what has been lost. Yet, just behind them stand two upright cups, untouched and waiting to be seen. The distant horizon glows with a faint light, hinting at a bridge crossing the river, leading toward a new path.

In this future, the card speaks of grief, regret, and the need to come to terms with loss. It represents a time of emotional upheaval, where the weight of what has been lost may overshadow what still remains. However, it also carries a message of hopeâ€”of the resilience to look beyond sorrow and find the strength to move forward.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to acknowledge their pain, but not to let it consume them. The vision reminds us that while loss is a part of life, there is still the potential for healing and renewal if we can turn our gaze toward what remains and find a way to cross the bridge to new opportunities.
