## ï»¿Three of Swords  
### Vision of heartbreak, sorrow, and regret giving way to deep understanding.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see a storm brewing over a darkened field. Three swords are thrust into the ground in a triangular formation, each one gleaming with a cold, silver light beneath the shadowed sky. Raindrops begin to fall, striking the swords and echoing like distant drumbeats, pooling at their base and staining the earth with rivulets of water. The air is thick with the scent of rain and loss, as if the storm itself mourns with the land, carrying whispers of past pains and unspoken wounds.

In this future, the card speaks of heartbreak, grief, and the sorrow of facing painful truths. It represents a time when the seeker may feel deeply wounded or vulnerable, as the weight of loss presses upon them. The three swords driven into the ground symbolize a painful experience that cuts to the core, yet the rain reminds us that acknowledgment and experience of that pain will allow healing to follow.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to allow themselves to feel this grief, for true understanding often comes through facing sorrow. The vision suggests that while pain is inevitable, it also holds the potential for growth and transformation. By embracing this moment, the seeker will find the inner strength to heal and move forward, demonstrating their resilience in the face of hardship.
