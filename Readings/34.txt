Six of Swords  
Vision of transition, where movement brings peace to turbulent waters.


As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene comes into focus of a mist-covered lake. A small wooden boat drifts across the water, carrying six swords lying flat at its base. The air is still, and the boat glides forward, moving away from a distant shore shrouded in dark clouds. Ahead, the mist begins to clear, revealing calm waters and a faint light on the horizon. The swords lie undisturbed, their weight stabilizing the vessel as it moves forward in quiet.


In this future, the card speaks of transition, release, and the journey toward calmer waters. It represents a time when the seeker is moving away from past difficulties, leaving behind old struggles to embrace a quieter path. The six swords in the boat signify the lessons of past experiences, while the calm lake suggests a place of peace awaiting on the other side.


The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to trust in this journey, to release what no longer serves them, and to embrace the path ahead. The vision suggests that while the transition may feel uncertain, peace is near, and each step forward leads closer to healing and resolution.
