## Seven of Swords  
### Vision of deception and concealed intentions.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, your eyes adjust to the dimly lit scene of a dense forest at dusk. Seven swords are scattered across the forest floor, their metal barely visible in the deepening shadows. Nearby, faint footprints vanish into the underbrush, leading away from the clearing, as if someone is slipping quietly into the night. The air is tense, filled with the feeling of hidden motives and whispered secrets. The swords lie abandoned, as though left behind by someone who wanted to remain unseen.

In this future, the card speaks of strategy, secrecy, and the complexity of intentions. It symbolizes a time when careful thought and discretion are needed, as not everything is as it appears. The scattered swords represent actions taken in secret, while the shadowed forest suggests that hidden truths or agendas may be at play.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to tread carefully and to be mindful of both their own intentions and those of others. The vision suggests that wisdom lies in watching closely and moving with subtlety, as certain truths may be revealed only in the time between actions.
