## Four of Cups  
### Vision of longing and missed opportunities in the midst of abundance.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see a solitary figure sitting beneath a large tree, gazing downward in deep contemplation. Before them lie three cups, filled with a golden liquid, shimmering in the pale light. From the mist, a fourth cup emerges, held gently by a ghostly hand, as if offering a gift. The figure does not reach out toward the hand, their attention is elsewhere, lost completely in thought. 

In this future, the card speaks of dissatisfaction, contemplation, and the risk of overlooking gifts that life is presenting. It suggests that, in focusing too much on what is missing or what once was, one may fail to notice new opportunities for growth and fulfillment. There is a yearning for something deeper, yet still, an unwillingness to embrace what is being offered.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to recognize the present moment and open their heart to new possibilities, even if they seem unappealing at first. The vision warns against letting apathy or discontent prevent the discovery of joy and fulfillment. Sometimes, the key to moving forward is already within reach; it only requires a shift in perspective.
