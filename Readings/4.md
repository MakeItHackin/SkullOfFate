## Four of Cups  
### Vision of longing and missed opportunities in the midst of abundance.

As you gaze into the hollow eye sockets, the scene forms of a weathered stone chapel, deep within an ancient forest. Inside, a solitary figure kneels at the altar, surrounded by crumbling relics and faded tapestries. Three goblets rest upon the altar, their contents untouched, while a fourth cup lies partially hidden behind a veil of ivy that creeps through the open window. The air is still, save for a faint breeze that stirs the ivy, revealing the hidden goblet's faint glow. Yet the figure remains unmoved, their gaze locked on the dark shadows flickering in the candlelight.

In this future, the card speaks of weariness, introspection, and the longing for something that remains just out of reach. It symbolizes a moment of disconnection from oneâ€™s surroundings, where opportunities lie unnoticed and the spirit struggles to find meaning. 

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to break free from their own stagnant thoughts and look beyond the surface for what may lie concealed. The vision suggests that fulfillment is near, but it requires a shift in perspective. Even in moments of solitude, there may be a light hidden in the quiet places.
