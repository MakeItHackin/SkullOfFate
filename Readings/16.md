## Two of Wands  
### Vision of paths diverging, where decisions mark the turning point of destiny.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a vision comes into focus at the top of a great stone tower overlooking a vast landscape. In the distance, mountains rise and rivers wind through fertile valleys. A figure looks out the arrowslit to the left and, in the distance, sees a single wooden staff firmly planted in a large stone, while to the right, a second floats gently atop a small lake of water. Each is unclaimed but within reach. The figure is poised and, while not indecisive, weighs the journey to each staff carefully in their mind. The land below is ripe with promise, yet the choice of direction remains to be made.

In this future, the card speaks of planning, decisions, and the power of potential. It symbolizes a moment when the seeker stands on the edge of possibility, with the world spread out before them. The two staffs represent the balance between contemplation and action, as well as the need to choose a path that aligns with one's vision. A decision must be made to move forward and pursue destiny.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to weigh their options carefully, understanding that each path offers different rewards and challenges. The vision suggests that this is a pivotal moment where foresight is critical. Whatever path is chosen, it will shape the course of what comes next.
