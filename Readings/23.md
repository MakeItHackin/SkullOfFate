Nine of Wands  
\#\#\# Vision of endurance and drawing strength from scars of the past.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you begin to see a rugged landscape, where a line of staffs stand side by side, deeply embedded in the ground. One staff is held higher than the rest, but it is worn and scarred, its wood rough and battered. The ground beneath it is dry and cracked, as though from the weight of many battles fought, and a faint fog rolls across the barren terrain. Behind the line of staffs, distant mountains loom, their peaks shrouded in mist and shadow. The air is heavy with the feeling of fatigue, yet the central staff still stands, weathered but unbroken, a testament to its endurance.

In this future, the card speaks of perseverance, weariness, and the strength to continue despite hardship. It symbolizes a time when the seeker may feel drained or exhausted from previous struggles, yet the will to stand tall remains. The battered staff represents past wounds and challenges that have been faced, but its upright position signifies that even in the face of exhaustion, there is still the capacity to endure and defend what has been gained.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to draw strength from their experiences and to remember that resilience is born from overcoming adversity. The vision suggests that though the journey has been difficult the ability to continue is the mark of true strength. Hold firm, for the end is near, and victory belongs to those who refuse to fall.
