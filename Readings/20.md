## Six of Wands  
### Vision of triumph, where victory is shared and recognized by all.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene forms of a grand procession moving through a wide street lined with towering banners. In the center of the procession stands a tall staff adorned with long golden ribbons that connect it at its point to five smaller staffs that are carried amongst the crowd. The path is lined with onlookers, and their cheers echo through the air, a chorus of voices lifting in celebration. The banners flutter in the wind as the staffs are carried high above, their golden ribbons gleaming in the sunlight. The sense of accomplishment radiates through the scene, not just from the ones who carry the staffs, but from the crowd itself, as if the victory belongs to them all.

In this future, the card speaks of recognition, success, and the joy of shared achievement. It signifies a moment when personal victories are not only acknowledged but celebrated by the wider world. The staffs decorated with the golden ribbon symbolizes triumph and honor, while the presence of the cheering crowd reminds the seeker that true success is often shared with those who have supported the journey.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to embrace this moment of victory and to allow themselves to be honored for their achievements. The vision suggests that this is not just a personal triumph but a communal one, where the efforts of many have contributed to the success of one. Take pride in what has been accomplished, but also recognize those who have walked the path alongside you.
