## ï»¿Eight of Swords
### Vision of fear and doubt forming unseen restrictions.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you feel an overwhelming sense of despair before the scene even fully appears. Eight swords stand in a ring around a barren patch of earth, their blades planted deep in the ground, forming a cage of steel. The sky is overcast, and a cold wind whistles through the gaps between the swords, yet no path exists beyond them. The air feels stifling as if the very presence of the swords binds the land in speechlessness. Outside the ring, the world lies open and free, but within it, the ground remains trapped and isolated.

In this future, the card speaks of limitation, fear, and the feeling of entrapment. It symbolizes a time when the seeker may feel restricted by self-imposed boundaries or by circumstances that seem impossible to escape. The ring of swords represents the barriers that confine them, whether from external forces or internal anxieties.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to confront these fears and to recognize that many of the barriers may be of their own making. The vision suggests that freedom is possible, but only by acknowledging the power of fear and challenging it. The cage is only as strong as the belief that it cannot be broken.
