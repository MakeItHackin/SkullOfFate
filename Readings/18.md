## Four of Wands    
### Vision of celebration, festivities, rejoicing, and hard work coming to a close.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a grand courtyard appears, its stone walls entwined with vines and flowers. Four tall staffs, wrapped in ribbons and adorned with garlands, rise from each corner of the courtyard, forming a square. In the center, a large banquet table is set with golden plates, and torches line the path leading toward it, casting a warm glow as dusk settles in. The air is filled with the sound of music and laughter, and the shadows of figures approaching from the distance start to dance on the ground. The scene hums with the anticipation of celebration and the recognition of something long-awaited.

In this future, the card speaks of harmony, achievement, and the joy of reaching a significant milestone. It represents a time when efforts come to fruition, and the foundation of something meaningful has been firmly established. The four staffs, standing tall and decorated, symbolize the stability of that foundation, while the empty courtyard promises the gathering of community and shared happiness.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to take time to honor their achievements and to celebrate with those who have walked alongside them. The vision suggests that while there is still work ahead, this moment is one to savor. Recognize the value of what has been built and allow yourself to experience the joy of this success.
