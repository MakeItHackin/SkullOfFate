## Seven of Cups  
### Vision of elusive choices, desires manifesting and dissolving fluidly. 

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene emerges within a mist-shrouded forest, where a figure stands before a circle of seven stone basins, each filled with water that reflects a different vision. As they gaze into the basins, the waters swirl and shift, revealing fleeting imagesâ€”a golden crown, a winding serpent, a radiant jewel, an open hand, a key, a flickering flame, and a mysterious figure. The images seem to rise from the water itself, taking on momentary forms before fading back into the depths. The air is thick with enchantment, and the figure struggles to distinguish between reality and illusion, unsure which visions offer true paths and which will lead them astray.

In this future, the card speaks of choices, temptations, and the challenge of navigating through enticing yet uncertain possibilities. It symbolizes a time when multiple paths present themselves, but not all are what they seem. Each basin represents a desire or aspiration, yet only some will bring fulfillment, while others may lead to disappointment or even danger. The swirling waters remind the seeker that what appears solid can quickly dissolve, and what seems distant can draw near in an instant.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to approach choices with discernment and to look beyond surface allure to understand the true nature of each option. The vision suggests that while the forest is filled with mist and uncertainty, clarity can be found by trusting one's intuition and recognizing which desires align with the heart's true calling. Not all that glitters is gold, and the wisest choice may not always be the most dazzling.
