### Seven of Wands  
### Vision of defiance and standing firm when faced with challenges.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see a winding mountain pass sloping upward and coming to its end. A single staff is planted firmly in the grass-covered ground, surrounded on three sides by stones and rock faces. The wind howls fiercely, swirling dust and debris around the scene, but the staff holds its ground. Marching up the pass from below are six dark figures, each carrying a pointed staff, preparing for a continued assault. Though the staff stands alone, it is unyielding, a symbol of resilience against mounting opposition.

In this future, the card speaks of defending one’s position, facing challenges, and standing firm in the face of adversity. It symbolizes a time when the seeker may feel outnumbered or under pressure, yet their strength and determination will be key to holding their ground. The dark, aggressive figures represent forces or obstacles that seek to displace the seeker, but the firmly planted staff signifies the power of resolve.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to remain steadfast and not give in to pressure or intimidation. The vision suggests that though the challenges may seem overwhelming, true strength lies in the ability to hold firm and maintain one’s position. The battle may not be easy, but resilience will be the key to success.
