## ï»¿Ten of Swords
### Vision of release coming at the edge of surrender.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a solemn scene takes shape. A vast, empty plain stretches out beneath a darkened sky, where ten swords lie sunken in the ground, forming a straight path that leads to the horizon. Each sword glints faintly, their edges dulled, as if they have been worn down by many battles. In the distance, the first rays of dawn break over the landscape, casting a cold, pale light over the scene. The air feels heavy with finality, yet a sense of peace pervades, as though the worst is now behind, and a new beginning awaits.

In this future, the card speaks of endings, acceptance, and the liberation found in letting go. It symbolizes a time when the seeker must release what no longer serves them, allowing a painful chapter to close. The swords lying on the plain represent past struggles and the culmination of effort, while the dawn symbolizes renewal and the promise of a new path.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to accept what is over and to embrace the peace that comes with release. The vision suggests that though the ending may be difficult, it is also necessary for growth. A new day is dawning, and with it, the opportunity to move forward unburdened.
