\#\# Eight of Cups  
\#\#\# Vision of moving forward in life, accepting change, leaving what no longer serves. 

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene unfolds of a rugged coastline where a steep, narrow path winds upward toward the cliffs. Crashing waves cascade over the dunes as eight goblets lie scattered in the sand, some upright, others overturned and half-buried. The goblets appear weathered and tarnished, as if abandoned for a long time. Up the path, a faint light glows from the heights above, beckoning something or someone forward, while the sound of the waves fades with every step.

In this future, the card speaks of departure, seeking deeper meaning, and the courage to leave behind what no longer serves. It represents a time when one must walk away from what has grown stagnant or unfulfilling, even if it once held value or comfort. The scattered cups signify old aspirations, relationships, or pursuits that have lost their luster, making way for new experiences or paths yet unexplored. The climb ahead is steep, but it leads to higher ground and a chance for renewal.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to acknowledge what must be left behind and to embrace the journey toward something greater. The vision suggests that the act of turning away is not a failure, but a necessary step in the search for deeper fulfillment. Even if the path feels uncertain, it is the willingness to move forward that will reveal the light waiting at the summit.
