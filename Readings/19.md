## Five of Wands     
### Vision of struggle and tests to one's strength and spirit.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a chaotic scene comes into view. On a rugged hillside, five staffs are locked in a tangled clash, their wooden lengths bending and creaking under the strain. The air is charged with the energy of conflict, and the ground beneath them is uneven, making every movement precarious. Each staff pushes against the others, competing for dominance, yet none gain a foothold or break. In the distance, storm clouds gather, darkening the sky and casting long shadows over the struggle, you feel the electricity in the air as a vicious storm quickly approaches.

In this future, the card speaks of conflict, competition, and the testing of oneâ€™s resolve. It symbolizes a moment when the path forward is fraught with challenges, not from external forces per se, but from a clash of ideas, ambitions, or personalities. The tangled staffs represent the struggle for position or recognition, where progress is hard-fought and hard-won. Yet, the storm in the distance suggests that this is a necessary part of growth, a forging of strength in the fires of conflict.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to remain steadfast in the face of adversity, recognizing that struggle is part of the process of refinement. The vision suggests that while competition may feel overwhelming, it is through these challenges that true strength and clarity of purpose are revealed. Stay focused, and rise above the fray to find your path forward.
