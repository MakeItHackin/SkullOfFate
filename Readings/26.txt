Knight of Wands  
Vision of untamed momentum, passion driving the way forward.


As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see a figure riding through a vast, open plain. The horse gallops at full speed, its hooves kicking up clouds of dust as it charges toward the sunset. In one hand, the rider holds a flaming staff out in front of them, as if splitting the air, its fire blazing brightly. The sun is low in the sky and casts long shadows on the ground, yet the rider shows no sign of slowing. The rider’s gaze is steady and their eyes are fixed on the horizon, as if being drawn forward by some unknown force that exists all around them. 


In this future, the card speaks of action, passion, and the pursuit of goals with fierce determination. It symbolizes a time when energy and ambition are at their peak, and the desire to achieve and conquer fuels every step forward. The flaming staff represents the burning desire of the seeker, while the swift horse embodies the momentum and drive that pushes them toward their objectives.


The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to harness this momentum and channel their energy with purpose. The vision suggests that while the fire of ambition is powerful, it must be guided with care to prevent it from burning out or scattering direction. Now is the time for bold action, but with the understanding that the journey requires focus to reach the destination.
